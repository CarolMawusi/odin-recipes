    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="items-needed">
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>6 chicken breasts</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees or 220 degrees C</li>
      <li>
        Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season
        chicken with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and
        pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a
        separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then
        egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean
        plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the
        sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue
        baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly
        browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 165 F degrees or 75 degrees C
