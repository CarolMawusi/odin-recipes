    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a delicious homemade Stroganoff sauce.</p>
    <p>Serve over Rice or Pasta</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into strips</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 cup mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Shake 1 tablespoon flour with salt in a large, resealable plastic bag
        until combined; add beef and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown beef
        in the hot butter, about 3 minutes per side. Stir mushrooms, onion, and
        garlic into beef; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 3 to 4
        minutes. Transfer beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving drippings in
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Cook and
        stir 3 tablespoons flour in the hot butter until smooth; stir tomato
        paste into flour mixture. Whisk beef stock into mixture and cook,
        stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return beef and vegetables to skillet and stir to coat with sauce.
        Reduce heat to very low and simmer until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours.
        The longer it cooks, the more tender the meat will be. Just before
        serving, stir sour cream and white wine into beef mixture and heat
        through. Do not boil.
